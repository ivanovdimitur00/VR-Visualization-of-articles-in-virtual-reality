## Project status
Completed and working. Not expecting changes.
<br/>
<br/>

## Description
The purpose and goal of this project is to create an application to be able to visualize articles, such as furniture and interion in a virtual environment.
The application is meant to be run on mobile phones, that have sensors that enable them to project virtual reality experiences.
The technologies used to create this application are the Unity Engine, the C# programming language and google's VR SDK.

The intended audiences for this application are my scientific advisor, myself and theoretically, people that go shopping for furniture.
